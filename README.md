# FederatedLearning-AMC-ClassImbalance

# Matlab code

generate modulation signal samples, whose SNR ranges from -10dB to 10dB

# Python code

FL-AMC

FedeCNN_xx_Balance is based on class balance trick and here, we use resampling the samples of the class with fewer samples instead of balanced cross entropy (convenient to implement, the two are basically equivalent)
